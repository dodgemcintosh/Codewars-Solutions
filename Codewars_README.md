# Codewars Solutions

This repo contains my explorations, solutions, and in-line explanations for Codewars solutions that I practice on a daily basis.

## Getting Started

Solutions for each language are in their corresponding language notebook i.e. the python_solutions notebook will contain problems and solutions in Python.

### Prerequisites

> If you want to get started with some practice of your own, just create an account at [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

> If you want to workshop your solutions in a Jupyter Notebook like I did, you'll also need to install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
